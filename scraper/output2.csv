Travel on Train Strike DaysTravel Question (self.uktravel)|emergentologist|2|7|So of course I'm booked on LNER for the day they just announced a strike (2 December). Fortunately, I was able to snag a Lumo ticket for that day before they sold out completely, and they aren't part of the industrial action.So how is travel on strike days? I've heard that LNER usually still runs a certain percentage of their routes, so my original train still might run (how long until they release the updated timetables for this day?). Is Lumo likely to be overrun with people standing in the aisles? Should I just bite the bullet and book a flight?
Advice please! Best way to get to the Natural History Museum from the M4 / WestTravel Question (self.uktravel)|TinChain|4|41|Hi. I'm planning a day trip to London from Bristol with my wife and 3yo son. We want to start the day at the Natural History Museum, followed by some other sights.We'll be coming on a Monday morning (leaving before 7), and will drive at least most of the way (trains prices are ridiculous...). I'm keen to get in as soon as possible to make the most of the day, so avoiding likely traffic / delays is important. We've lived in London before so are familiar with the tubes etc - but not since the Elizabeth line started running, and not post-Covid (I hear Mondays are a bit less manic in town now?).Given traffic / queues for trains, tubes etc, would we be best off:Driving to Osterley / another Piccadilly line station, getting the tube from thereDriving to an Elizabeth line station (Maidenhead / Slough / somewhere else)Driving more centrally and parkingSomething else entirelyI've been trying to use Google Maps / Citymapper for this but I can't see a way to work out if there's a best place to drop off the car and make the switch to public transport. If there's another route planner I'm not aware of please say.Once I've found the best option I'll try to book a space on a driveway or something so parking shouldn't be a problem. Oh and hotels the night before aren't really an option (no childcare for our youngest).Any tips gratefully received, thanks!

Leicester in Feb? Worth it yay or nay?Travel Question (self.uktravel)|HerbysBreadLoaf|0|8|Hey guys, so I‚Äôve been following the premier league since around 2013 and didn‚Äôt have a team until I watched Leicester City have that miracle run in 2015 and have been a diehard fan ever since. I‚Äôm hoping to plan a solo trip in Feb 2024 to watch two home games, hopefully see Vardy, my favorite player, play in person. I‚Äôve been reading that the winter weather can be quite dreadful around that time. That being said, I‚Äôve got a toddler at home and likely will have another newborn late next year, so this is basically the only season I could make a trip in the next 5+ years since I really don‚Äôt want to straddle my poor wife with 2 kids at home by herself. I‚Äôve been wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to go? Having some cold feet about the weather and if it‚Äôll really put a damper on the trip? Hoping to fly into Heathrow, see London for 1.5 days then take a train to Leicester, stay there the week, possibly a day trip to Birmingham, and then fly out of BHX. Thanks in advance

Planning a June countryside trip. Advice needed!Travel Ideas (self.uktravel)|AdRemarkable4895|18|48|I'm planning a trip with my friend (two women) for mid-late June to the UK. We're from the US and we've both been to London and Edinburgh, so we're looking to do a little more exploration in the countryside, or at least outside the major metropolises.We're having a tough time narrowing it down because there's so much to choose from. Just for background, our interests for this trip include spending time in pretty villages, staying in old inns, seeing dramatic cliffs, maybe some prehistoric or at least medieval ruins, and, if I'm being honest, maybe some Jane Austen-adjacent tourism. We love what we love. We love food but both are mainly pescatarian, we like walking, and we love a good bookstore.If you have any recommendations on the broad criteria above, I'd be grateful to hear them, but I also had a few specific questions:How are the tourist crowds from June 13-25? I've heard Cornwall is crowded in the summer but was hoping this would be early enough. Any bank holidays to worry about? Will Polperro be insane?Can you recommend ruins that are near a town that's also worth seeing? We want to avoid traveling to a place solely for ruins that we'll see for a half hour so we're trying to get more bang for our buck.We'd like to walk around a forest and are thinking of Dartmoor. Any recommendations there? We like a moderate hike.For the cliffs portion of the trip, if we were to go to Cornwall, which do you think is best for a first-timer?Thank you!

Opodo more expensive than direct?Travel Question (self.uktravel)|AwareCollar9559|0|2|Hey all,I bought a package on Opodo prime day sale for ¬£707, UK to LA.I ended up cancelling the hotel and I got an invoice confirming that the flight was ¬£506, via BA.I decided to see what flight prices were directly, and for the exact same day, time, both economy, its currently ¬£456?I called Opodo to question this and they initially lied saying they gave me a different type of economy. Then a different agent said it's because of limited tickets at the time of sale? But the original tickets are still on BA?‚ÄãI'm now in a position where I need to transfer the ticket but I called and they quoted ¬£200. I was confused as the ticket I want to transfer to is also ¬£456? It's one thing paying a more expensive ticket but what sort of travel protection am I even paying for if the transfer is also this expensive?Are they allowed to do this? I payed via credit card. Am I able to dispute this under false advertising as I bought these tickets during their sale? and then I can book directly via the airline?I called today asking for a breakdown receipt on where the charges are going which they said they will try to provide in 24 hours.

Applying for a visitor visa earlyOther (self.uktravel)|Altruistic_Border674|3|5|"My extended family is visiting to meet my baby (their grandson). But they are traveling to another country in  the Schengen area first to visit their daughter and they're planning to spend there about 80 days (they can stay up to 90 days there without a visa)They're traveling in February and they would be in the UK in April. If they apply in January, it's too close to the intended date for travel and it's too risky if the passports don't arrive on time. 
So ideally they would like to apply for the standard UK visitor visa around end November, early December for a trip in April.We know of the option to pay extra to get the decision quicker but it's not affordable for us at the moment (and I'd much rather spend that money taking them to do tourism in  Cornwall to be honest)I suggested switching the trip to start in the UK but apparently the dates on the other country are non negotiable due to the availability of their daughter.Would it be feasible to apply so early?

Good London hotel for family of 4Travel Question (self.uktravel)|Difficult-Desk5894|2|8|Looking for a hotel where the 2 kids each get their own beds (not sofa beds) that's reasonably nice as well as in a good location for sights/transport to the sights (specifically Tower of London, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, the Zoo, and we want to go to Hampton Court too but that's a whole day trip regardless of where we stay).Doesn't necessarily need to be seperate sleeping areas for us/the kids but also it would be nice to be able to stretch out a wee bit (ideally would have a lounge/tv area seperate from the sleeping area..)Really like the look of the Docklands Doubletree but I think the location probably isn't ideal. Don't really need a kitchen etc and would prefer somewhere with reception staff etc so apartment rentals are less appealing.  Love the look of the Cheval Aparthotels but they are abit over our budget.Looking to spend about 500GBP per night.Thanks so much for any advice :)‚Äã

I'm also planning to visit Copenhagen during the winter. Can you tell me about your experiences there during the winter season? Is it a pleasant time to visit, and how many days do you recommend spending in Copenhagen? Are there options for finding halal food?
My return flight is from the UK. Is it common for people to store their luggage before flying with budget airlines?
Thank you so much for your help and advice."
Give me the real unvarnished truth about London hop on hop off bus toursTravel Question (self.uktravel)|this_is_sy|62|124|I'm headed to London with my partner and our 6 year old in December. We are experienced travelers who are good to walk distances, including our child. We're good at public transit. I spent 12 years living in NYC, where there are lots of hop on hop off tours, and to me they seemed like a pointless waste of money for dumb tourists who didn't realize you can literally walk up to the majority of sights on the tour, for free. And actually go inside and experience them.I've been to London before, many years ago, but my partner and child have not. Interest-wise, we are more into history, literature, art, culture, and food, and less into churches and the royals.I keep seeing recommendations for hop on hop off bus tours, especially for kids. Give it to me straight. Should I suck it up and do one because my kid will like it, or is my perception that they're overpriced BS accurate?UPDATE: It looks like people's feelings are really mixed on this! While I am still leaning more towards just grabbing a regular London bus on the first morning of the trip and seeing if we really want more than that, reading folks' comments got me to revisit the idea of the London Pass. Generally I find these schemes a poor value for money, but indeed we are planning to see a few places covered, with tentative plans for others. And it would include a HOHO bus if we wanted to do that. So maybe if we opt for the London Pass, we'll also do the bus tour?

I need help with travelling options from London to Exeter.Travel Question (self.uktravel)|elifelifelifelif|4|22|Hello, I don't know if this is relevant to this sub, however, if not please accept my apologies and skip.We (I and my husband) are moving to Exeter from an another country. Since we are moving with our cats, the only option for the entry is London for us.The options I found so far are,Trains: As far as I know, this is the fastest and the most comfortable way to travel. However, I think, it might be difficult with that much luggage and cat boxes. Also we will need to change trains as well.Coach: I read that they are not accepting pets. So they are out of option.Car rental: This is the most expensive option because it will be one way. Also, we are not new drivers but I don't know if it is a good idea to drive  that long as it will be our first experience of driving at left handed traffic.Any idea or recommendations will be appreciated .Thank you.
Fastest and safest way for my mother to go from Heathrow to Gatwick in rush hourOCTravel Question (self.uktravel)|Albbatros|94|136|Hi! I have a question about the fastest way to get from Heathrow to Gatwick airport in rush hour. My mother (70y) needs to go from Heathrow (Terminal T5) to Gatwick (South Terminal). She arrives at Heathrow at 8:15 in the morning and has her US flight at 12:30. She only has  4h15 mins to do the change, and she will be traveling only with hand luggage. The flights have the same operator, so hopefully she will not have to check in again in Gatwick. Thank you in advance! (first time ever posting in reddit, so if I have done it wrong, my apologies)

Why didn‚Äôt the uk use the new emergency alert systemTravel Question (self.uktravel)|AldiMealDeals|393|237|So as we all know by now, some parts of the UK including some major cities were flooded over the weekend which started on Friday the 20th of October.  This caused major disruption on the roads, with some people taking nearly 6 hours to complete a journey that would normally take 15 minute, and sadly also resulted in the loss of life.Earlier in the year, the government rolled out an emergency txt alert system for a variety of circumstances which included severe weather.  However this system was never used throughout the duration of the weekends extreme weather, which if it had been used, probably would have spared many from being stranded as well as supporting local emergency services.So I ask you, what was the purpose of the national emergency txt alert system & does the government ‚Äúallow‚Äù for some emergencies to take place without notification?  Furthermore, how much money did it cost the tax payer to fund a system that was never used when it was actually needed.  #batshitbonkersbritain

London itinerary adviceTravel Ideas (self.uktravel)|jprallster|5|63|I'm working on a very rough itinerary for a London trip for spring '25 with my husband (both early 40s). I realize that's extremely far in advance, but I know that if I don't start planning, it'll never happen. We'll be flying into Heathrow and I saw a suggestion to take the Elizabeth line because it's less crowded than the Piccadilly line. If that's true, I'm willing to pay more for that. I plan to stay near Paddington Station because it's close to the tube and not too far away from attractions. I figure we'll spend around $200-ish a night. I'm strongly considering the Pilgrm because it's a minute walk from the station and you get a discount at their lounge if you book directly.The rooms are small, but we won't be there much.These days aren't necessarily in order and will depend on what days things are open, the weather, etc. I have TONS more on my list that I want to do and I'm thinking some of these days can be combined. But I'm not trying to make this an insanely tiring trip where we spend all of our time rushing from attraction to attraction. I want this to be an enjoyable, low-key trip since London has been on my bucket list for decades.Likes: literature, quirky and/or macabre things, history but not war history, tea, perfume, natureDay A: Highgate Cemetery, Hampstead HeathDay B (weekday): Camden Market and Camden Market Bucks St, Amy Winehouse statue, Freud Museum, Primrose Hill neighborhoodDay C: The Sherlock Holmes Museum, Regent's Park, London Zoo?Day D: Millennium Bridge, Tate Modern, Shakespeare's Globe, St. Paul's (tour and Evensong)Day E: V&A, Science Museum, Natural History MuseumDay F: Brompton Cemetery, Hyde Park/Kensington Palace, Beatrix Potter plaqueDay G: Sky Garden (considering the AM coffee and pastry option to hopefully avoid crowds), Jack the Ripper museum and tour (preferably the feminist one), Tower of London,  St. Dunstan in the East Church GardenDay H: Covent Garden mall (Perfumes de Marly and Penhaligon's stores), afternoon tea at Sketch, Soho, bookshops on Charing Cross RdSunday: The Lamb and Flag for Sunday RoastI'd also like to fit in a Thames cruise.Is there anything on my list that isn't worth it? Any MUST-sees that I'm missing? Like I said, I have a lot more on my list, but this hits all of my high priority visits with everything grouped together more or less by location.I'm also interested in restaurant suggestions. Dishoom, The Breakfast Club, Fishcotheque, Tayyabs, and St. Steven's Tavern are on my list. Open to any cuisine.Thanks!

Detailed Trip Info - Three Weeks in Scotland and EnglandTravel Ideas (self.uktravel)|StudioRat|22|24|Warning - wall of text follows.We have just returned from a trip to England and Scotland, and I thought I might share some information for those who may be planning something similar.  We are Canadians, and we flew out of Pearson International in Toronto on IcelandAir.  We spent two days in Iceland, six days in Scotland and fourteen days in England.Note regarding our trip costs - we chose a particular style of trip, which involved staying in pretty nice AirBNB‚Äôs where we had the entire unit to ourselves and eating most meals in pubs or restaurants.  The cost of our trip reflects that style of travel.  Your mileage may vary.  If you‚Äôre comfortable staying in hostels or simpler accommodation and/or preparing most of your meals, your costs could be much lower.  If you want to stay in five-star hotels and eat in Michelin starred restaurants, your costs will be much higher.  Either way, the costs I‚Äôll list below can serve as some type of benchmark for what a trip might set you back.We are a retired married couple, and we travelled for the first two weeks of the trip with another couple - close friends that we have travelled with before.  For the final week of the trip, we parted company and they continued on to Paris for a few days. We remained in England for another week and I took the opportunity to visit family members that live there.  This last week also included three days in the Cotswolds, where we were simply looking for a quiet time - a holiday from our vacation.ITINERARYOur itinerary was as follows:Day 1:  Travel DayDay 2:  Reykjavik, IcelandDay 3:  Reykjavik, IcelandDay 4:  Edinburgh, ScotlandDay 5:  Edinburgh, ScotlandDay 6:  Portree, ScotlandDay 7:  Portree, ScotlandDay 8:  Portree, ScotlandDay 9:  Glasgow, ScotlandDay 10:  Chapel Stile, EnglandDay 11:  Chapel Stile, EnglandDay 12:  Chapel Stile, EnglandDay 13:  Liverpool, EnglandDay 14:  St Albans, EnglandDay 15:  St Albans, EnglandDay 16:  St Albans, EnglandDay 17:  Bedford, EnglandDay 18:  Moreton-in-Marsh, EnglandDay 19:  Moreton-in-Marsh, EnglandDay 20:  Moreton-in-Marsh, EnglandDay 21:  Brighton, EnglandDay 22:  Brighton, EnglandDay 23:  London, EnglandDay 24:  Travel DayThe stopover in Iceland was an afterthought.  We booked tickets through IcelandAir because they were a good price.  They offer a stopover deal where you can stay in the country for one to seven days, then resume your onward connection.  Seeing as we were landing there, it felt like a waste not to at least get a taste of the country so we decided to stay over for two days.There was no direct connection on IcelandAir to Edinburgh, so we landed in Glasgow and immediately took a train to Edinburgh, where we stayed for two days. In Edinburgh, we picked up a rental vehicle.From Edinburgh, we drove up to the Isle of Skye, where we stayed in Portree.  Our main focus while on Skye was walking and hiking.From Skye, we drove south to Glasgow.  To be honest, the stopover in Glasgow was simply to break up a long driving day on the way to the Lake District.  We only stayed in Glasgow overnight.We drove to the Lake District and stayed in a tiny village called Chapel Stile for three days.  Again, our focus was walking and hiking.After three days in Chapel Stile, we drove to Liverpool where we did some sightseeing and some Beatles stuff.From Liverpool we drove to St Albans, just north of London.  This was the home base for our three days visiting London.  We didn‚Äôt stay right in London because of the noise, hustle and bustle and expense of the city.  Instead, we took an early train from St Albans each day and returned at night.  We returned our rental vehicle when we arrived in St AlbansAfter our three days seeing London, our friends departed by train to visit Paris.  We remained in England and took a train up to Bedford, where I have family members.  We visited there for one day.From Bedford, we took the train to Moreton-in-Marsh, a small town in the Cotswolds.  As I mentioned previously, this was intended to be a quiet, rest-oriented stay since we had been traveling continuously for two weeks.After our three days in the Cotswolds, we travelled south to Brighton, where I also have family.  We visited there for two days.From Brighton, we travelled up to a hotel near Heathrow to get prepared for our flight the following day.   We flew from Heathrow back to Pearson in Toronto with a very brief stop at Keflavik Airport in IcelandTRIP COSTSAs mentioned above, we stayed in AirBNB accommodations.  We used a rental vehicle for two weeks and also travelled by train / bus / tube when we didn‚Äôt have the car.  We mainly ate breakfast before leaving to start our day, and ate the remaining meals in pubs and restaurants.  Occasionally we ate simple dinners in our accommodations if we weren‚Äôt that hungry, or if we didn‚Äôt have the energy to head back out for dinner.Our costs were as follows (these are $CAD - you can convert as necessary)Flights                     $2,212   IcelandAir - economy classAccommodations  $4,176   AirBNB‚Äôs and one hotel at HeathrowTransportation        $2,445  Car rental, fuel, trains, busesFood and Drink        $3,151  Restaurants, coffee stops, groceriesAttractions                   $940  Admissions to attractionsMiscellaneous             $962  Travel insurance, SIM cards, cash for tipsSouvenirs                     $673   Nice wool sweater, a couple bottles of scotch, a few T ShirtsTOTAL                       $14,559TRANSPORTATIONOur rental vehicle was a Ford passenger van. We had four passengers and our luggage, so a car would not have worked for us.  The van wasn‚Äôt huge, but it felt that way at times compared to the vehicles around us. The van had an automatic transmission and was diesel fueled.I struggled with the driving.  Despite being a confident, competent driver at home, the combination of very narrow roads, roundabouts and opposite-side driving never settled in for me.  I found it hard to judge my position on the road, and always felt like I was too close to the centre line.  I tended to drift off to the left to the point that my tires would hit the shoulder.  After a few attempts, I delegated all of the driving to the other person, who seemed to be much more comfortable with it.Not a criticism, and we were expecting this - but it‚Äôs hard to appreciate just how narrow the roads can be in rural areas of the UK.  Most of the time you will not find any type of shoulder.  In many areas, you‚Äôre contained within stone walls right at the edge of the road.  Many of these roads have occasional widenings so that vehicles can squeeze by each other.NAVIGATIONOur rental vehicle had a built-in GPS, which was useful.  It had very good displays of which exits to take and which lane to enter and exit from in roundabouts.What it was not good for was finding attractions such as hiking or walking trails.  For that, we relied on Google Maps. Our operating mode was to have the driver, plus a navigator in the front passenger seat.  That was my role.  I would watch the GPS and tell our driverthings like ‚Äúyou need to take the second exit from this roundabout - basically you‚Äôre going straight through,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking exit 123, which is coming up in half a mile.‚ÄùFor finding things like the ‚ÄúOld Man of Storr hike,‚Äù or ‚ÄúQuiraing Hike,‚Äù on the Isle of Skye, Google maps was essential.  The built-in GPS was useless at finding these.  As a navigator, most of the time I was keeping an eye on both the car GPS and Google maps on my phone.It‚Äôs worth noting that we were frequently without cell phone reception in rural areas of both Scotland and England, so downloading the maps to Google maps is a good idea.  Of course, GPS signal works regardless of phone service, but you should be aware that you may not have the ability to see a map or to perform a search for a location if you lose service.PHONESWe pre-purchased SIM cards for both of our phones with a UK phone number.  We got a large data package with those SIM cards, because we didn‚Äôt want to be worrying about running out.  All of our communication apps like Signal and WhatsApp worked just fine while we were there.  Only disadvantage is our regular Canadian numbers were not accessible for the three weeks we travelled. The UK SIM cards worked flawlessly, including our time in Iceland.THOUGHTS ON OUR TRIPIcelandThe shuttle from Keflavik airport to Reykjavik took about an hour, and cost us $92 CAD per couple each way, so $185 CAD in total to get to and from Reykjavik. We found Reykjavik to be a little underwhelming.  It is very tourism-focused, and basically a city full of gift shops, cafes and restaurants.  Not sure if this was typical, but morning rush-hour traffic was horrendous.  We found the people (including shop workers) to be a bit cool and standoffish.  In some cases they were downright unfriendly bordering on rude.  That‚Äôs not a reflection on us - we‚Äôre outgoing, friendly, chatty, not demanding and respectful of store and restaurant staff.  Possibly this was a reflection on us arriving at the end of peak tourist season, and they were simply tired of dealing with the influx of visitors.On our second day, we took a small-bus tour to a number of iconic sites along the south shore.  The tour cost us $308 CAD (for two)  and was in a Mercedes bus with about 15 people on board.  It was a fantastic experience, and our only real option to see these areas without a rental car.  We saw waterfalls, glaciers, the black sand beach and the basalt columns.  A great (Hungarian) driver who was chatty, friendly and knowledgeable. The tour took us about eleven hours start to finishKeflavik Airport is not huge, and it is clearly operating at well above capacity.  There are many, many flights arriving and departing and it can be a challenge to accommodate all of the passengers.  There is insufficient room to properly queue up for boarding, so groups just mill about in a huge mob by the gates while waiting to board.  The lack of gates mean that you will as likely as not have to take a shuttle bus from your plane to the terminal; and vice-versa.Glasgow / EdinburghWe had to make a choice between the two cities, and ended up choosing Edinburgh because it seemed to be the better choice for history and architecture.  That being said, we did land in Glasgow on our IcelandAir flight.  We took a double-decker shuttle bus from the airport to downtown Glasgow, then walked a few blocks to the main train station.  We were lucky enough to arrive just in time to get a train to Edinburgh and were there in just over an hour.We loved Edinburgh - it‚Äôs a beautiful old city and we spent the majority of our time simply walking the streets on the Royal Mile and admiring the city.We did pay for admission to the Royal Yacht Britannia, which has  permanently docked there as a floating museum since it was decommissioned.  It was actually a very fascinating visit from a historical perspective, and we all enjoyed it thoroughly.While we were in Edinburgh, we picked up our rental vehicle to use for the following two weeks.Isle of SkyeI always hesitate to choose favourites, but Isle of Skye was magical.  The rugged scenery is jaw-dropping.  It was like being in a Lord of the Rings setting.  Our primary activity there was hiking.Old Man of Storr - a straightforward but strenuous climb to see this famous pinnacle.  We got a little bit of rain, and some of the strongest winds I‚Äôve ever walked in - the type of winds that can blow you off your feet.  Verdict: spectacular, and well worth the climbFairy Glen - a gentler meander through paths between odd-looking hills and outcrops.  Easy and fairly level, but some very interesting scenery - worth the walkThe Quiraing - a crazy drive on narrow roads to get there, and absolutely no signage to help you find your way.  The first half hour of the walk is quite easy, then it gets tougher with some narrow trails along drop-offs.  We unfortunately arrived to steady rain and the same strong winds we had encountered at the Old Man of Storr, so we cut the hike short at the half-hour point.  Still incredible views, and worth the scary narrow-road drive up there.Fairy Ponds - a linear trail that runs beside a stream/river with intermittent ponds, rapids and waterfalls.  Quite beautiful, but very busy (Even in October).  You‚Äôll be walking in a long lineup of visitors.  Still worthwhile to do.Recommendation - the earlier you arrive at these hiking locations, the quieter they‚Äôll be.  If you[re an early-bird, you‚Äôll have a much better experience.We toured the Talisker distillery, which was an interesting experience. I‚Äôm a single malt fan, so I particularly enjoyed it.  The tour wasn‚Äôt too long, but enough to understand the whisky making process.Chapel Stile (Lake District)Beautiful, pastoral area and unfortunately, the most rainy portion of our trip.  Chapel Stile is a small village with a population of less than 300 people.  We loved the local pub there - quintessential British pub with low ceilings, exposed beams, fireplace, friendly staff and good food.  We used the town as our base for exploring the area, including other towns like Keswick.Took the boat across Derwentwater and climbed Catbells - nice scenery from up there, but it‚Äôs a long, uphill climb on a gravel path.  The hike itself wasn‚Äôt too interesting, although that may have been affected by the steady rain.Spent a little bit of time in Keswick, and while it‚Äôs a pretty town, it‚Äôs very busy with tourists and basically a whole town of shops and cafes.  It is hiking headquarters for the Lake District,  and the tourist info place there was very helpful when we wanted information on various hikes.We did a half-day driving loop that was described in Rick Steve‚Äôs Great Britain book and it was amazing.  Scary narrow roads in places, but the scenery was spectacular, particularly the section that went through Honister Pass.LiverpoolWe drove south to Liverpool and stayed for only one night.  Went to the Beatles Story (exhibit and museum about the band) and it was OK but not as good as we were expecting.  Lots of memorabilia.  Decent audio guide included with your admission.The whole waterfront area along the Mersey has been redeveloped and it‚Äôs quite nice.  We wished that we had at least another day for the City rather than the one-day stop we‚Äôd planned.St Albans / LondonSt Albans is a decent place to operate as a base, although the train was more expensive than anticipated ($115 CAD for two of us each day).  We honestly didn‚Äôt spend any time in St Albans - it was where we slept.London was busy, frantic, noisy and amazing.  We bought tickets for two days on the hop-on, hop-off bus which was a fantastic way of getting around the city.  We‚Äôd simply ride until was saw an area we wanted to explore, and get off.The city is architecturally stunning, and of course filled with iconic sites.  We‚Äôre not museum / attractions people, but we did pay for admission to Westminster Abbey (stunning and well worth the price of entry) and the Churchill War Rooms - the underground bunker where Churchill and staff directed the war effort (fascinating if you‚Äôre a history buff).We had three days in London, and despite walking our feet off and spending long days there, we of course never scratch the surface of all there was to see.BedfordClose to London, and for us an opportunity to visit with family that lives there.  I couldn‚Äôt tell you much about the town.Moreton-in-MarshIt took a few trains to get from Bedford to Moreton-in-Marsh via London, but it was doable.  A bit annoying carrying luggage, but it wasn‚Äôt too bad.A quaint, beautiful town in the Cotswolds.  It was a rest stop for us, with no ambitious plans.  Afternoon naps and easy walks for the first two days were the order of business.  On the final day we did an 14 km (9 mile) loop walk through the countryside and through several small towns along the way.  Gentle walking through farm fields and little towns - we loved it.BrightonWe had naively planned our travel day from Moreton-in-Marsh to Brighton on a Sunday.  In retrospect that wasn‚Äôt a great idea.  Trains run less frequently, and it seems to be the day chosen for all track maintenance.  One leg of the journey had a cancelled train and a replacement bus for that section. The journey included a train, a replacement bus, a second train, two rides on the Underground in London and a final train down to Brighton.  Five long hours carrying our luggage, but we made it there.Brighton was another stop primarily to visit family, but we did have an opportunity to visit the Lanes (downtown area narrow alleys and small squares), the Royal Pavillion (former Royal palace) and go for a nice, long walk along the seaside from the Brighton Pier to the  Marina.We got the impression that Brighton had a pretty active vibe, and would have lots to see.HeathrowTook a coach (bus) from Brighton up to Heathrow Airport and a Hoppa Bus (shuttle) from Heathrow to our hotel.  What can I say?  Typical airport hotel but it gave us an opportunity to organize, repack and get ready for our flight the next day.Flying HomeAbout 2 ¬Ω hours from Heathrow to Keflavik, a frantic and congested 1 ¬Ω hour layover to change planes, and a straightforward flight from Keflavik back to Toronto.FINAL THOUGHTSWe felt that the three-week duration was about right.  In nearly every location we stayed, we felt that it would warrant another day or two, but our budget wasn‚Äôt unlimited, and living out of a suitcase loses its charm after a few weeks. We came back tired (as we should) which told us we had squeezed enough in, but we never had the feeling that we were exhausted, racing from place to place trying to fit in everything we could.  We left all of our evenings open to pick and choose what we might want to do, but rarely did anything. We tended to have a late (mid-afternoon) lunch, then a fairly late supper.  By the time we were done dinner, we had little energy or ambition to keep going.The quality of food in pubs and restaurants was way, way better than we expected.  The UK doesn‚Äôt have a reputation as a foodie location.  We didn‚Äôt eat fancy, but everywhere we stopped the meals were fast, fresh and served piping hot.  Even pubs serving traditional fare like steak and ale pie or fish and chips often included well cooked local vegetables.  We had some (not surprisingly) great Indian food while we were there.Prices for food and drink were moderately high but not outrageous.  A fancy coffee and a piece of baking or a scone would often cost ¬£6 to  ¬£10.  Pub meals were in the  ¬£30 to  ¬£0 range. Stopping in a pub for a pint and a glass of wine would cost about  ¬£12.  Iceland was the only exception.  We‚Äôve all heard that Iceland is very expensive, and it lived up to its reputation.Flying was not fun. We didn‚Äôt face any insurmountable obstacles, and our luggage never got lost  but I‚Äôve come to the belief that flying is a necessary evil to get where you want to go.The weather was very changeable.  We dealt with temperatures ranging from 0 deg to 20 deg C (32 deg to 70 deg F).  We had sunny days, cloudy days and torrential rain.  For the most part, we had at least some good weather each day - even if there was some rain, we often got breaks from it at some point in the day.  We never let rain stop us - we brought good rain gear and waterproof hiking shoes. Fog and mist can be an issue for sightseeing at times - it‚Äôs frustrating to climb a trail to find yourself in the middle of a cloud.A USB power bank was almost essential for keeping phones operating while traveling and driving.  Any GPS app like Google maps seems to just burn through battery life.If you have questions, fire away - I‚Äôll try to answer if I‚Äôm able.‚Äã

Confused on passport control traveling between Ireland and UK. Can anyone explain?Travel Question (self.uktravel)|Cold_Snow_3781|11|27|Hey! Just visited Ireland for the first time and I'm just a little confused on how passport control etc. Works.When I arrived in Ireland, I went through some kind of passport reader gate. I presume this notes my entry into Ireland. When I landed back in the UK, I got off the plane and was able to walk straight through and out of the airport.Given this, if I was to visit somewhere in the EU next year (let's see Spain for example), wouldn't the system show that I visited Ireland and never left? And wouldn't that possibly pose an issue from a 90/180 day rule standpoint?Thanks!
Paid 400 pounds for taxi and over 900 pounds for airticket due to floods. What to do for insurance claims?Travel Question (self.uktravel)|penelopeblue330|1|10|I was in Sheffield, supposedly taking a train to London St Pancras, and eventually arriving at Heathrow for a flight on 20 Oct. All such trains (including direct ones and alternatives routes with changes were cancelled). I ended up taking a costly direct taxi to rush for the flight (which I missed). I understand that this is natural disaster and I couldn't blame EMR too much except for their lack of timely updates (they just keep on delaying trains giving people false hope and eventually cancelling them).To support my insurance claims, should I write to National Rail to request a formal statement on the cancelled train schedules? Any other information you think is important and I shall gather? I will definitely check with my local insurance agents as I came to UK for travel only but any other ideas are appreciated.

London AdviceTravel Question (self.uktravel)|doni-sunshine|1|39|I (F31) am planning a solo trip next fall to London. I just need some help to figure out exactly where in the city to stay. I‚Äôm not trying to create any sort of itinerary. I mostly just want to walk around, see the sights, drink plenty of tea, and read a good book or two (preferably with rain pattering on a nearby window). I would love any recommendations for locations (and any small places to enjoy a quiet cuppa) that y‚Äôall can give me!UPDATE: Based on the recommendations (and warnings) and my own hotel searches, it looks like Bloomsbury is the winner! There are numerous hotels with very reasonable rates, great proximity to King‚Äôs Cross, and is walkable to sights. Thanks a million!
